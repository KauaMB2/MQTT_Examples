Publishing and subscribing (or subscribing) are fundamental actions in the MQTT protocol, which is a lightweight and efficient messaging protocol for communication between devices on networks with limited bandwidth.

Publishing to an MQTT broker means sending a message to a specific topic, which is a message identifier used to categorize messages that are sent in the protocol. When a message is posted to a topic, the broker has forwarded that message to all devices that are "listening" (that is, subscribed to) that topic.

On the other hand, subscribe to an MQTT broker means that a device subscribes to one or more specific to receive published messages those provided. When a message is posted to a topic that a device has subscribed to, the broker has forwarded that message to the device.

Thus, devices that publish and those that subscribe to an MQTT broker can communicate effectively, allowing IoT solutions, monitoring and control in real time, among other applications, to be integrated.
